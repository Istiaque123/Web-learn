        The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack
        each other.
        Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any
        order.
        Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both
        indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
